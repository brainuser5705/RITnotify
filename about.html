                    TigerBot is a Discord bot made for RIT students, by RIT students. It is host to many features specific for RIT such as RIT dining, social medias, etc. Its extensibility and ease-of-use can make many Tigers's life at RIT much simpiler.

                <div class="about-questions">Why Discord?</div>
                <div class="about-answers">
                    Over the years, Discord has risen to become one of the most popular networking platforms. Thanks to Discord's <b>bot</b> feature, many developers and hobbyists can design, create and build bots of all kinds. We saw this is an opportunity to create a bot for the students of RIT. With the numerous APIs out there, there is never something TigerBot cannot have.

                <div class="about-answers">
                    We hope that this project can still in development. Although maybe it will not be a full one, brick by brick we can build TigerBot into at least something that be of use.
